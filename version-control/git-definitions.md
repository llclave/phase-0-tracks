# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. It allows us to have a record of the various versions of our project and the changes made to it. It is useful to continue to update our files while keeping a record of the changes we have made. If we ever want to undo a certain change we have made, we would be able to go back tp a previous version.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a movable pointer to a certain snapshot or commit of your project. It can be a copy of the main project at a certain point in time. Branches allow you to work on a separate copy of your project. Rather than working directly on the main files and potentially introducing a bug, you can work to refine your code on a branch. Then, later you can integrate any changes made to your master branch. Branches also allow multiple teams to work on changes on a project simultaneously.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a save point for your branch/ project. After making changes to your files, you can commit those changes which saves your project with a message. A good commit message describes your changes while being specific and meaningful. 


* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict occurs when a user is trying to merge two branches and each branch contains a different version of the same file. The two branches may have modified versions of the same lines in a file. Git will mark a conflict since it would not know which what is correct. You can choose how to resolve merge conflicts after understanding what happened and understanding why there is a conflict.
