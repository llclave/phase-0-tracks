# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to record changes to a file(s) over time so that you have the ability to go to a specific version later. It is useful because in case you get an error with a commited version you can go back to the previous and be able to apply correct changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy or meer image of the master folder. You would create branch to apply your modifications. This way your changes are never messed with in the main folder and your changes are easily made. It also helps when different people are working on seperate changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit records changes made in the repository. A good commit message has a descriptive information about the modifications made in not a very long sentence.

* What is a merge conflict?

A mege conflict is an error that occurs when making a commit or pull request to a repository. It occurs because there are certain descrepencies between the branch and master that need to get fixed before moving on.
