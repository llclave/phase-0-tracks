## Release 1: Study Up
What seemed to be the most effective is to view and learn from many different sources. Various sources have different approaches to teaching the subject and also provide their version on what is most important. After reading an overview of jQuery, learning what it was, and what it was used for, I went over some tutorials. These tutorials helped me to learn practical and specific uses of jQuery.
