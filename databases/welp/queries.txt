You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

Query:
SELECT * FROM users, businesses, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

Output:
id|first_name|last_name|id|name|id|stars|comment|business_id|user_id
4|Steven|Wonder|6|Sushi World|1|3|average food|6|4
3|Angela|Jolie|6|Sushi World|2|5|food was amazing!|6|3
5|Holly|Berry|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|1|worst day of my life|1|5
5|Holly|Berry|3|The Beagle Nightclub|4|5|better than the wedding chapel|3|5
1|Bradford|Pitt|5|Plumbing by Janet|5|4|nice|5|1
2|Mandy|Kaling|2|Amir's Towing|6|5|you can tow me again|2|2
7|Denzel|George|2|Amir's Towing|7|0|never showed up|2|7
6|Merryl|Streepman|4|Lotus Yoga|8|5|I can touch my toes now|4|6
1|Bradford|Pitt|3|The Beagle Nightclub|9|4|there were so many beagles but it needs more|3|1
3|Angela|Jolie|6|Sushi World|10|2|I'm allergic to dogs but the instructor insisted|6|3



There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

Query:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;

Output:
first_name|last_name|name|stars|comment
Steven|Wonder|Sushi World|3|average food
Angela|Jolie|Sushi World|5|food was amazing!
Holly|Berry|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|worst day of my life
Holly|Berry|The Beagle Nightclub|5|better than the wedding chapel
Bradford|Pitt|Plumbing by Janet|4|nice
Mandy|Kaling|Amir's Towing|5|you can tow me again
Denzel|George|Amir's Towing|0|never showed up
Merryl|Streepman|Lotus Yoga|5|I can touch my toes now
Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|4|there were so many beagles but it needs more
Angela|Jolie|Sushi World|2|I'm allergic to dogs but the instructor insisted



How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
You need to add the command: WHERE businesses.name=“<business name>”

Example Query:
SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id WHERE businesses.name=“Sushi World”;

Output:
name|first_name|last_name|stars|comment
Sushi World|Steven|Wonder|3|average food
Sushi World|Angela|Jolie|5|food was amazing!
Sushi World|Angela|Jolie|2|I'm allergic to dogs but the instructor insisted
